	 <p>Uncle Tanner's was founded by a man named Alexander Mertsch on October 6th, 2027.</p>
	 <p>Ever since he was a young lad, Mertsch was always a big guy for pizza - it was his absolute favorite food that he simply could not get enough of.</p>
     <p>This personality trait of his would persist all the way up to adulthood and it would be the pillar of inspiration for him to open his business.</p>
	 <p>Mertsch would name his business after his younger brother Tanner since he felt it would give the establishment a more personal attachment to him and his family.</p>
